            <p>Along the way I'm inclusive. As a firm believer in the power of diverse thought and voices, I value perspective and cherish feedback. As a creative professional, I especially believe in the joy of teamwork. I try to be the glue of most teams, cracking jokes when there’s a need for comic relief, bringing up the latest pop culture reference when there’s awkward silence, but regardless of the situation I knowa that a team with bonded camaraderie and trust always functions higher! Outside of work I stay creative and engaged by attempting to prove that Pinterest DIYs are possible, playing jackbox.tv and board games, and spending lots of time outside with my dog Maggie! </p> <br>
