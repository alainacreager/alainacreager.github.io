		<h1>Portfolio</h1>
		<p>I joined this course so that I can work on moving my current <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alaina-creager/">UX design portfolio</a> off of <a href="https://www.squarespace.com">Squarespace</a> and start building and hosting it by hand.</p>
		<h2>About me</h2>
		<p>I'm is a UX practitioner. I creates research protocols, run user interviews, and analyze results. I evangelize insights, convert them into concepts, curate design ideation, and eventually develop prototypes that (after a few iterations) lead to implemented design solutions. Along the way I'm inclusive. As a firm believer in the power of diverse thought and voices, I value perspective and cherish feedback. As a creative professional, I especially believe in the joy of teamwork. I try to be the glue of most teams, cracking jokes when there’s a need for comic relief, bringing up the latest pop culture reference when there’s awkward silence, but regardless of the situation I knowa that a team with bonded camaraderie and trust always functions higher! Outside of work I stay creative and engaged by attempting to prove that Pinterest DIYs are possible, playing jackbox.tv and board games, and spending lots of time outside with my dog Maggie! </p>
